# Sudoku-Solver
This GUI application and lets the user play a game of sudoku and the computer checks each of the user's checkboxes by calculating the solution itself.


## How to Play
In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Output
When you open up the game, the GUI will look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Wed9gMCXmDhOSY1tGYIk9bQeA3Oy8o2/view?usp=sharing

Click on the individual boxes and type whatever number fits in that box. When you type a number in a box, it will look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nBNZFi5l2Iax5I7FSp-hoXtFigcl233X/view?usp=sharing. (1st row, 3rd column)

Now, if you want to check whether your answer is right, simply click enter. The computer will calculate the solution to the sudoku and check your input. If you enter the correct number in the correct box, the number will lock in like so: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RHXN9uJyV2iW-JKc-CSE0w2jmPVre9jB/view?usp=sharing. (5 was correct in this case)
However, if your input is wrong, the box will reset to blank and a red "X" will appear on the bottom left of your screen, like so: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YpyI3p0qZr6aScxzTRhc2YVnkKinCkxr/view?usp=sharing.

Keep trying, and you will solve the Sudoku in no time!
